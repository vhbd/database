    "description": "NRedneck (previously Rednukem) is a fork of EDuke32 that adds support for Redneck Rampage and Rednack Rampage: Rides Again.\nRedneck Rampage is a 1997 first-person shooter game developed by Xatrix Entertainment and published by Interplay. The game is a first person shooter with a variety of weapons and levels, but has a hillbilly theme, primarily taking place in a fictional Arkansas town. Many of the weapons and power-ups border on nonsensical, and in some ways it is a parody of both first shooter games and rural American life.",
