    "description": "Galactic Federation is a top down Action Science Fiction RPG. This is an early sample of 1 dungeon, but the full game is planned to be much bigger. The game currently features 4 classes, but I recommend the Human\/Marine since he is the most fleshed out character. The goal of the demo is just to explore the dungeon, and kill all of enemies. The demo also features a boss fight. Controls can be viewed and changed in the options screen on the main menu.",
